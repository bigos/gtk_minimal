This is my struggle to move beyond the basics and write a program that works with Gtk4.

** My Emacs setup

** Starting everything
Start Linux terminal and enter the following commands

#+begin_example
cd ~/Programming/OCaml/gtk_minimal/
opam exec -- emacs &
opam exec --  dune build
#+end_example

** Struggling with OCaml
