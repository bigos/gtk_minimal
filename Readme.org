This is my struggle to move beyond the basics and write a program that works with Gtk4.

** My Emacs setup
https://github.com/bigos/prelude/blob/ee2ff8fcc2f9cf0382bd365495413060dc274039/personal/organised.el#L607

** Starting everything
Start Linux terminal and enter the following commands

#+begin_example
cd ~/Programming/OCaml/gtk_minimal/
opam exec -- emacs &
opam exec --  dune build
#+end_example

** Giving up on OCaml
While OCaml seems to promise certain advantages I did not have much success.

I am huge fan of dynamic typed languages and can't be convinced with static languages.

Id rather spend hours trying to figure out a bug in dynamic language than spend
frustrating hours where static language won't compile, infuriate me with cryptic
errors or won't provide me with the information needed to solve the problem.

I may come back now and then, but now I had enough!
