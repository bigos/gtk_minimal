This is my struggle to move beyond the basics and write a program that works with Gtk4.

** My Emacs setup
https://github.com/bigos/prelude/blob/ee2ff8fcc2f9cf0382bd365495413060dc274039/personal/organised.el#L607

** Starting everything
Start Linux terminal and enter the following commands

#+begin_example
cd ~/Programming/OCaml/gtk_minimal/
opam exec -- emacs &
opam exec --  dune build
#+end_example

** Question
Is it possible to use cairo2 library here?

If it is possible how do I use cr in main.ml in the function  cairo_draw_func ?
